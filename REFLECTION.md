# Reflection

# What made your assistant “personal” to you?
I think the stress factor as tasks build up but lowers as things get done. Also I like the name Squeegee.

# What challenges did you face using this?
I had a hard time wrapping my head around when to update the mood. I decided to just write a function that calculates the mood on the amount of tasks. Then call that function inside the add and remove functions.

# Which method would you improve or expand?
Maybe add more levels to the mood calculator. I currently only have 3 states but adding a few more would be fun. Maybe if the tasks reach 20 throw out a head exploding emoji.
